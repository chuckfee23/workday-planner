# workday-planner

-Created a workday planner that displays the current day and the working hours of the day using html, css, jquery, bottstrap, and moment.js
-The time blocks of the day will display gray when in the past, red during the current hour block, and green for any hour blocks in the future
-The user can add to-do's into the text fields for each time block and save them so that when the page reloads, they repopulate in the corresponding time blocks
